The difference is that stocks, bonds, and banks are all regulated by the Federal government, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  They have to follow very stringent Federal regulations.

Usually the tower location information is available with a subpoena only, and is so technical you would need an expert witness to analyze the data. The only practical way to get a copy of the content of a text message is to see if it is saved on the phone that sent or recieved it. Do you have it saved on your phone?

Do you know when the judgment entered?  Did she default by not showing up for court?  Maybe there's a way to undo the default judgment.  See if you can find the case number so I can look it up on Courtview.Ultimately, assuming the suspension is legitimate, and the judgment can't be undone, the way to get her license back is to contact the law firm (better to have an attorney do this) and figure out the amount of the judgment, and set up a payment plan for the amount of the judgment.  These insurance companies just want money, so if you can come up with a realistic payment plan they will usually work with you, since they know your niece is able to earn more if she has a license.  Once you enter the plan, DMV will lift the suspension.  But if she misses a payment then the law firm can ask DMV to bring it back.","2018-06-01 01:18:40"

15,AK,849D1969-A7DF-4C0D-9819-4CE3DEF86BAB,"Hi ###,It sounds like you're wondering whether to ask for spousal support in your divorce.  Spousal support is generally disfavored in ### in favor of unequal property distribution.  What this means is that instead of getting a check from your husband every month for the rest of your life, the judge is more likely to just give you more of his property - a bigger share of the house when it sells, or one of his vehicles, or something else of value. Normally marital property is split 50/50, but the judge might split your property 60/###. The idea is that once the two of you are divorced, the judges think it's probably better for your finances to be completely separate.  That said, there are a few instances where I have seen it ordered.  It is always in the case where one spouse (usually the husband) has a much higher income or earning potential.  Typically, in these cases, the lower-earning spouse (usually the wife) has been out of the workforce for a long time, either being a homemaker, raising children, or because she has a disability.  She doesn't really have the means to support herself on her own. If this fits your situation, you might be a good candidate for spousal support. I have also seen courts order "rehabilitation support", which is basically payment to the lower-earning spouse while she is in school.  If you are in school during the divorce, you could get spousal support to support you until you graduate.  Support would end then, because then, presumably, you'd be able to get a higher-paying job.  Here are some good resources on the things ### looks at for spousal support: --Here's a video made by some retired ### judges about spousal support - https://###lawhelp.org/resource/spousal-support?ref=7RSiX --Here is the court system's explanation of what spousal support is - http://courts.###.gov/shc/family/shcspousal.htm But all this is about spousal support that lasts after the divorce is done.  You haven't filed your divorce yet.  Sometimes it can be a year (or more!) after a divorce is filed before it is finally done and you are legally divorced.  (BTW, the parties can stop living together at any point in the process.  You don't have to be legally divorced to stop living together.  You or your spouse can move out before the divorce is filed, or after, or when you file.)  It is not uncommon at all for lower-earning spouses to seek "interim support."  Interim support is income from your spouse to help you support yourself while the divorce is pending.  So if you file the divorce today, you can ask for interim support to start next month and continue until the divorce case is finished.  This type of support is pretty common.  You could figure out how much your spouse has been contributing to your monthly budget and ask that he be ordered to continue paying that. You can also ask for Interim Attorney Fees.  So you could ask for $### spouse to help you hire an attorney.  If you asked for interim support or interim attorney fees, the judge will want to make sure that you really are low-income. Keep in mind that there's no disadvantage to asking for these things.  It's better to ask for the moon and not get it than to not be awarded spousal support because you weren't sure whether you should ask.  And you need to ask at the beginning.  My advice would be to ask for spousal support, interim support, and interim attorney fees.  Usually the worst that can happen is that the judge will say no. Good luck! ","2018-04-27 23:52:20"

Itâ€™s very common.The best way to address this is to be up front with the Court about your background, and address any outstanding problems. That basically neutralizes they other sideâ€™s ammunition against you.Is there an out of state warrant? Some states extradite from ###, and some states donâ€™t. It may also depend on the severity of the crime. Some states have policies that they wonâ€™t extradite for misdemeanors. Some might not extradite if the case is old. Or some states just might not have the money for an extradition.Addressing the out of state issue and getting it resolved would solve two problems. First, your ex would no longer have any ammunition to use to manipulate you. And second, it would show the Judge that you take Court orders seriously and are a responsible person. Running from this issue never makes things any better. Is it really worth not having access to your child to stay on the run? Itâ€™s probably best to contact the out of state court and get the issue resolved. Also, if the judge asks you in court whether you voluntarily signed the agreement, you should be honest. If your ex made you sign it by blackmail, thatâ€™s something that really reflects badly on her. But the judge doesnâ€™t know she did that unless you are honest with the court. Good luck.

26,AK,D5DB6D4B-5828-4613-BC13-F98EDE415CA1,"Hi Mr. ###,It sounds like you have some concerns about how much information the lawyer is seeking about your life.In court cases, there is a process called "discovery."  Through the discovery process, each side asks the other side about information in their life that might be relevant to the case. Sometimes it can seem like the information being sought is of a very personal nature.  I can certainly understand that you don't want the lawyer looking through all your medical records, or information about your volunteer work.  It probably seems to you like this is very personal information that should not be shared. Unfortunately, in the discovery process, you usually have to turn information like that over.  If you don't want to, you can file a Motion for Protective Order with the court.  A Motion for Protective Order would be your way of asking the judge to limit the information the other party can get. The way courts work, if you don't cooperate in discovery, then the other side can file a Motion to Compel.  And they can seek attorney fees if they prevail.  That's completely normal under the rules of court.You could also try to work things out without making them file a Motion to Compel.  You could call up the other attorney and ask what else they need from the doctor, and provide it voluntarily without having to make them file a Motion to Compel.  You can ask what information they are looking for about the non-profit, and provide it to them.  The more cooperative you are, the better chance you have of avoiding legal costs.  In addition, it's probably better for your custody claim if you can cooperate with the other parent on various legal issues. Going up against a lawyer can be difficult.  If you are the lower-income partner, you could file a motion for interim attorney fees, asking your ex to pay for you to get an attorney. Good luck.","2018-05-18 00:14:52"

You also have another child that is not biologically related to your wife.  Please respond to this message if I have that wrong.Your adopted child is your child.  You are a legal parent of the adopted child.  That means that he would be treated in a divorce or dissolution as though you were his biological parent.  In other words, when you adopted your son, you agreed to be his Dad for the rest of his life, regardless of whether you stay married to his mom.  He is your son. In a divorce, the court presumes that the parents will have 50-###, unless there is very good legal cause to do something else.  Generally, the spouse with the higher income pays child support to the other.  If you don't plan to do 50-###, the child support calculation can change. It depends on the income of the parents and the custody schedule. You don't say how long you have been with your wife.  Are the two children bonded as siblings?  If so, spliting them up might not be a great idea. If your wife has been in your biological child's life for many years, you and your wife may decide to schedule your child some time with your wife after the divorce, even though they aren't biologically related.  For instance, if your child was a teen and your wife was the only Mom the child ever knew...then completely ending the child's relationship with your wife might have pretty devastating consequences on the child.  Judges can allow for a visitation schedule for a non-biologically related parent if it is in the child's best interest.

57,AK,8ACEE520-D44C-4BDB-9933-507BE05EDDFD,"The court has already set date and time for the pretrial scheduling conference (### at ###).  You don't need to do anything about the date/time unless the date/time that the court picked is inconvenient for you, in which case there's a process for asking for permission to attend by telephone (if you're available but can't be at the courthouse) or for asking the court to move the event to a different date/time (if you're not available at all).  The ### thing is a different issue.   In a lawsuit, the court rules (specifically, Civil Rule 26) say that the parties/attorneys should talk about exchanging information, scheduling of case events, etc., and make a plan for how the case will proceed.  Things that get discussed include:what trial dates would be convenient for each side (the judge will make the final decision about a trial date, but most judges ask the parties for their preferences and take into account things like availability of key witnesses)whether either side wants to take depositions (in-person witness interviews in front of a court reporter)whether either side wants to use a lot of formal discovery (information-gathering)In most cases like yours, the court issues a routine order, like the one you got, directing the parties (a) to have that discussion at least ###, and (b) to file a written report at least ###.The specifics of what a judge expects the parties to do vary from judge to judge.   I can't tell you anything about the habits of the judge assigned to your case since I don't have any experience with her.   But, most judges don't expect either side to put a lot of time and effort and money into a case that involves a ### for less than $10,000.   So, even though the court rules say that you're supposed to do a lot of things, in reality most of those things get ignored in cases like yours since no one wants to run up a big ### for attorney fees for case preparation.  (I'm not advising you to ignore court rules or court orders -- I'm just ### that parties and attorneys often don't follow the letter of the rules in cases this size because the dollar amount at issue doesn't warrant all that work.)So what should you do?   Send NDR a copy of the order you got and ask them to fix this by, say, the end of July.

69,AK,4E5CAD1A-88A4-4D5C-9E90-E776D2F4AEE2,"Hi ###, I see that you have a question about a possible employment case. Civil cases have two things you have to prove, essentially two different phases.  The first phase is "liability."  If you brought a lawsuit against the state for employment problems, you would have to prove that the State of ### violated the law in some way.  Plaintiffs in civil suits have to bring a claim.  Claims are things like discrimination based on race, or some other impermissible basis, or breach of contract.  You would have to say what law the state violated. From what you've written here, I'm not sure what the legal claim would be.  There is a legal claim called "breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing."  Under this claim, you would have to prove to a judge or jury that the employer treated you unfairly, and differently than they should have treated you under the circumstances.  ADN columnist ### ### talked about this claim in a ###: https://www.adn.com/business/article/###-###-bullying-isn-t-illegal-or-it/20###/ The second phase of the case is the "damage" phase.  If a judge or jury finds that the employer violated the law, then you could bring in all the costs and harm that you have had to suffer because of the employer's bad conduct.  Most of what you list in this question is relevant to damages, not to liability.  Counseling costs, decrease to your retirement, and lost wages are all part of damages phases of court cases.  (Generally plaintiffs hire an economic expert to calculate the lost wages and loss to retirement accounts.  That calculation can be tricky.)You also asked about harm to your reputation.  Harm of this type is very difficult to prove.  I tried googling your name.  Googling employees is completely legal and employers and potential employers do it all the time.  One of the first few results is an ### Supreme Court case from ### ###.  In light of that criminal case, which is public, I think you would have a difficult time convincing a judge or jury that UAA ruined your reputation.  It is completely legitimate and legal for an employer to fire you or decline to hire you because of prior DUIs. That many also indicates a drinking problem. If I were your lawyer, I would not pursue this claim in your case. I'd probably prefer to try to keep these convictions out of the case completely. It sounds like there is a lot more to the story here.  I would suggest meeting with a lawyer who focuses on employment cases.  The ### Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service is a great place to start.  You can call ###.  They will give you the names of ###.  (Make sure to ask for "employee-side", not "employer-side".)  Many employment lawyers in Anchorage have free consultations, and some work on "contingency", meaning they don't get paid unless you win, and then they get part of the award.

75,AK,C78F41CE-9A5F-4D06-92F0-9780B2299B10,"Hi ### - You have not been tricked by the judge.  Here are a couple of ideas on how to proceed:First read Civil Rule 16.2.  https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdYou may withdrawal if you have no other alternative, but I would recommend caution doing so since then the formal rules of evidence and trial apply. See Rule 16.2(d).Take a look at 16.2(e) and how the court will proceed informally and whether that procedure will allow you to get the information in that you need to tell the court your side of the issues.  Also before withdrawaling, consider exploring if you can get the evidence you seek through some other means than directly from him. Is there some particular piece of information that is missing that you need in order to present your case to the judge in October?  If so, I'd let the judge know that you need X piece of information or a certain document and that you have tried other ways to obtain it and after those efforts can only get it from him.  You will need to be able to explain how the piece of information is central to an issue of material fact - i.e. a fact that the court will be required to resolve.  Credibility of your husband will likely not be sufficient, but something substantive like land/property division or child custody might.You say you need to present evidence of"for the defendants chronic, professional lying capabalities and actions.  The Judge said, I would still be able to present my evidence." You will need to show how the information you seek isn't available through ###. While you husband's veracity and character may be an issue, you will need to demonstrate to the court how what you seek from him in terms of disclosures, bears on that issue as it relates to a material fact - again, ### division or child custody. Also is he the best person to get information from through something like disclsoures if you do not trust that he will be truthful?At this point you still have plenty of time before your October trial date. Try to get your information alternatively and if you make reasonable efforts and cannot find another way to prove some material fact, let the court know through a motion explaining very clearly why you need it and can't get it from elsewhere. Good luck,### ###","2018-06-25 16:15:16"

85,AK,103B16DE-7CE4-4DE0-9D5B-C640D0CE51A6,"Hi ###,I understand you want to change your son's last name to your last name. The thing to know about changing a child's last name is that it is for appearances only.  It does not legally change in any way who the child's father is or if the child is connected to his father legally.  It does not give you any more custodial rights as his mother or remove his father from his birth certificate or keep your ex from seeking custody of your son or anything else.  Literally nothing changes except for show.  If your ex has not made any effort to be part of your son's life, I strongly recommend you file for primary custody.  You will have to serve your son's father, or make significant efforts to serve him with the court paperwork.  But once you do that, and he has a chance to be involved in the court case, then you are in a much stronger position.  In the cases that I have seen, if the other parent has made no effort to support the child or spend time with him, then the court easily grants custody to the loving parent.  It's almost a no-brainer.  But the judge has to at least give your ex a chance to say his piece.  Once he does, and the judge grants you custody, you're on very solid legal footing.  I'd recommend getting custody squared away before filing for the name change.  If you have sole legal custody, then changing your son's name isn't difficult.  If you don't have judge-approved legal custody though, it will be harder to change your son's name unless his father gives consent.  Here is some information on filing for a name change.  http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcname.htm If your ex does not want his son's name changed, the court would have to find some good reason to go against his wishes.  Your ex is still legally your child's father, so he would still get a say in the name of the child.  Again, I recommend getting primary custody and sole legal custody of your son before you seek the name change.  It would put your position on much more solid legal footing.  You can find out how to file for custody here.  http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shccustody.htm Watch the videos.

But, if your husband owed the contractor money, the contractor's remedy is to file a claim in the probate case for your husband's estate  (if a probate case was ever opened and if the deadline for filing claims hasn't already passed).  If there isn't a probate case, the contractor theoretically could open a probate case in order to have a place to file a claim, but the dollar amount involved isn't worth the expense and hassle of opening a probate case even if the estate has money to pay a claim. If your husband owed anything, are you responsible for that debt?   As a general rule, a wife isn't responsible for her husband's debts.   Can you make the contractor stop pestering you?   There's not a lot you can do to make the contractor stop trying to make you pay.   He can sue you if he wants to.  It doesn't sound like he'd win the case, but the court would accept his paperwork and you'd have to deal with the lawsuit.   If he's bothering you at work, you can ask your boss to "trespass" the contractor from your workplace.   That means your boss tells the contractor that he is not allowed on the premises and that someone will call the police/Troopers if he shows up again.

106,AK,AAC2D6F7-F8D5-4263-92B9-D6DFAED01F12,"Hello, I am the non-custodial parent (mother) of a ### daughter who's primary residence is in ### with her father. I live in Ohio and am ordered no less than ###. The father has refused to send the child in 2013, 2014, and only sent her for ### 2018. When she arrived she was in psychological distress including having severe depression and suicidal ideations. The child does not want to return to ### for the school year.I filed a Motion for Interim Custody along with a Motion to Modify Custody and for Expedited Consideration on ###. The Expedited Consideration was denied by the judge along with an ORDER to return the child which was signed on 8/13. Again, the child does not want to return to ###.My question is, if I feel that the situation the child is living in ### is unsafe and we are waiting for a decision or a schedule for a court date on a filed Interim Modification of Custody and Modification of Custody, is it mandatory to send the child to ###, as a mother conserned for my child's mental health, I do not feel right about sending her to ###. Please advise. Thank you! ","2018-08-17 01:59:12"
